#2. Build a method `key_for_min_value` that accepts an argument of a hash. This method should iterate over the hash and return the *key* (not the value!) that points to the smallest value of the set. If the method is called and passed an argument of an empty hash, it should return `nil`. 
#* `#key`
#* `#keys`
#* `#values`
#* `#min`
#* `#sort`
#* `#sort_by`
#* `#min_by`

#**A Helpful Hint:** 

#* Think about how to determine which value is the lowest. Do you need to compare each value to something as you iterate? 
#* Think about how to collect or store the correct key. Remember that you need your method to return *just this key*.
