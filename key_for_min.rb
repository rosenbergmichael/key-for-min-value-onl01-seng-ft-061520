# prereqs: iterators, hashes, conditional logic

#2. Build a method `key_for_min_value` that accepts an argument of a hash. This method should iterate over the hash and return the *key* (not the value!) that points to the smallest value of the set. If the method is called and passed an argument of an empty hash, it should return `nil`.
